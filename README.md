# PDF_chatapp_AI

**Introducing **PDF Chat AI App**! ðŸš€**

Chat seamlessly with multiple PDFs using **Langchain, Google Gemini Pro, and FAISS Vector DB** for lightning-fast, accurate responses. Powered by the awesome **Google Gemini Open-Source Language Model**, this app transforms your PDF experience with instant, intelligent interactions.

With** Streamlit Deployment,** it's all available at your fingertips. ðŸ“šðŸ’¬
**Transform your PDF experience now! ðŸ”¥âœ¨**

The application follows these steps to provide responses to your questions:

**PDF Loading **: The app reads multiple PDF documents and extracts their text content.

**Text Chunking** : The extracted text is divided into smaller chunks that can be processed effectively.

**Language Model** : The application utilizes a language model to generate vector representations (embeddings) of the text chunks.

**Similarity Matching **: When you ask a question, the app compares it with the text chunks and identifies the most semantically similar ones.

**Response Generation** : The selected chunks are passed to the language model, which generates a response based on the relevant content of the PDFs.


**Requirements for PDF_chatapp_AI :**
